## Data Models

### Trading Pairs
- Symbol, base/quote assets
- Current price, 24h change, volume
- High/low prices
- Favorite status, category (spot/futures)

### Market Data
- Historical price data for charts (OHLCV)
- Timestamps for time-series data

### Orders
- Wallet address, symbol, order type
- Buy/sell side, price, amount
- Status (pending, filled, cancelled)
- Category (spot/futures), leverage

### Assets
- Wallet address, asset symbol
- Total, available, in-order balances
- USD value calculation

### Transactions
- Type (deposit, withdrawal, trade)
- Asset, amount, status
- TxHash for on-chain verification
- Timestamps

## Development Workflow

### Running the Application
```bash
npm run dev
```
This starts both the Express backend (API) and Vite frontend dev server on the same port.

### Building for Production
```bash
npm run build
```
Output is generated in the `dist` directory, ready for Netlify deployment.

### Deploying to Netlify
1. **Connect Repository**: Link your GitHub/GitLab repository to Netlify
2. **Auto-Detection**: Netlify will automatically detect the configuration from `netlify.toml`
3. **Build Settings** (auto-configured):
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist/client`
   - Functions directory: `netlify/functions`
4. **Deploy**: Click "Deploy Site" - Netlify will:
   - Build the frontend with Vite (optimized chunks for faster loading)
   - Deploy the serverless API function at `/.netlify/functions/api`
   - Set up SPA routing with proper redirects
   - Handle all `/api/*` requests through the serverless function
5. **Note**: Build runs on Netlify's servers (no local build needed due to memory constraints)

### Architecture Notes
- **Frontend**: React SPA built with Vite, deployed to CDN
- **Backend**: Single Netlify serverless function handling all API routes
- **Storage**: In-memory (resets on function cold starts - suitable for demo/MVP)
- **API Routing**: `/api/*` → `/.netlify/functions/api/*` (transparent to frontend)

### Next Steps for Production
1. Add database persistence (Neon, Supabase, etc.) to replace in-memory storage
2. Integrate real DEX protocols (Uniswap, PancakeSwap, etc.)
3. Add SUI network support with non-EVM wallet integration
4. Implement wallet transaction signing for on-chain trades
5. Test wallet connection and order placement flows end-to-end
6. Add comprehensive error handling and loading states

## Design Guidelines
See `design_guidelines.md` for comprehensive design specifications including:
- Typography system
- Color palette and theming
- Component usage patterns
- Layout specifications for each page
- Responsive behavior
- Accessibility standards

## Environment Variables
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Express session secret (already configured)
- MetaMask wallet connection via browser extension (no API key required)
- TradingView widgets use public CDN (no API key required)

## Supported Networks
- **BASE** (Default) - Coinbase's Layer 2 network
- **BNB Chain** - Binance Smart Chain
- **Arbitrum** - Ethereum Layer 2
- **SUI** (Coming Soon) - Non-EVM network requiring specialized wallet integration

## Notes
- Professional CEX-like landing page with compelling marketing copy
- TradingView integration provides live market data from major exchanges
- Multi-chain support via MetaMask for seamless chain switching
- SUI network appears in selector but shows "Coming Soon" message (non-EVM)
- **Serverless backend** complete with Netlify Functions
- All API routes converted from Express to serverless handlers
- In-memory storage (suitable for demo; resets on cold starts)
- Ready for immediate Netlify deployment with full-stack functionality
- Real blockchain integration would require connecting to DEX protocols (Uniswap, PancakeSwap, etc.)
